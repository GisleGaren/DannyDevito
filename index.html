      Hi, my name is Danny Devito aka Danny boy. I’m a 44 years young male studying my last year at NYU. 
      What I’m studying? Glad you asked, I’m finishing my masters in arts so in other words I’m unemployed at the moment. 
      If my cat could talk she would describe me as a bubbly, young, colorful, beautiful and loving man who deserves nothing but the best. She really is my biggest supporter, and my partner in crime. 
      Oh and before I forget I also paint and would love for you to review my art and employ me, I guarantee to bring joy and laughter to the art studio. 
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h2>List of hobbies</h2>
    <p> 
        <ul> 
            <li> Taste tasting wine </li>
            <li> Look at art with milkshake (my cat) </li>
            <li> Go to paint and sip every other week with a new tinder date </li>
            <li> Look out the window and daydream about how easy my life would have been if I took a degree in anything else than arts</li>
            <li> Watch the office on repeat (michael scott if you're reading this please contact me on my email)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> And as my biggest hero Michael scott would say: </p>
    <blockquote> <em>"The only time I set the bar low is for limbo and men over 6 feet”.</em> </blockquote>
     <p> - I added that last part. </p>
