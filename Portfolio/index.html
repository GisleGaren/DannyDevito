          <p>
            This artwork was my first project ever, a portrait of myself. 
            I loved doing this piece, adding the texture and colour, lights and shadows was fun, but at the same time difficult. 
            When I started painting this piece, I didn't have any experience in art. 
            Therefore this artwork is very special for me, and also a memorable moment because it was whilst painting that I understood my reason to be here and that I found my passion in my life.
            I also painted myself skinnier, which is why I love to paint, I get to paint whatever I want and how I want.

          <h3>Flower power</h3>
          <p>
            Flower Power is a personal and natural piece. 
            This was created as a dedication to my late cat Cherry, her favorite flowers. 
            The thought of my baby having her favorite flowers in my home forever made me paint this.
            I wanted to create happiness and vibrant energy in this piece. 
            Milkshake can’t stand this piece, jealousy if you ask me.

          <h3>Late Night Vibes</h3>
          <p>
            This was my view from when I would sell hotdogs in the busy streets of New York. 
            I would always dream about living in these amazing skyscrapers. 
            After years of suffering and selling hotdogs and paint for hours I live in an apartment 
            the size of a shoebox in Manhattan for 200 000 dollars a month. 
            Life really is amazing, just keep believing and grinding and you will get there too.

          <h3>Ocean Eyes</h3>
          <p>
            I met this boy in Africa, and his eyes were just drawn to me. 
            His eyes reminded me of an ocean and I could spot them 1000 miles away. 
            I kindly asked him if I could do a painting of him and he said no, 
            therefore I stalked him for a week straight to memorize how his eyes looked. 
            After that I asked for a date and sadly I was rejected, I think it was because of my height.
