    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>

      For the preparations we used our lectures and finished our lab projects. We also used the website 
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" style="color: white">W3Schools</a>
      if we were unsure of which HTML and CSS tags to use. 
      
      For the layout of the website, we structured each tag in head and body. In body we distributed each class in header, nav, main and footer. To further structure we included our links in nav tags.
      We used a google-doc to write all the text before copy-paste in HTML. In this way we could predict which words and sentences needed specific semantic tags. For the quotes we chose to use the semantic tag "em" to highlight the quotes.
      We chose to use external files when coding the CSS, to have all the CSS-codes in one place and linked the CSS style sheet to HTML file. Just like that, it was more structured and we had more overview over our own coding.
